# Project Color Guess

[Live demo](https://phlima.com/projects/color-guess)

Last updated: October 2023

## Context

Color Guess was proposed as a bonus project for block 5 of the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) Web Development course. In this block we study fundamental JavaScript concepts such as the DOM ([Document Object Model](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)), element manipulation, events and [Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API). This is a color guessing game based on RGB and Hexadecimal codes.
